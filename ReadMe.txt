OverView:
This application is designed to collect user information and store it locally using Redux Toolkit. It consists of two main pages:

1-User Information Input Page: This page allows users to enter their information, which is then stored locally using Redux Toolkit.
2-User Information Display Page: This page retrieves the stored information, pre-fills the fields accordingly, and makes them editable. Any updates made by the user are saved back into Redux.
3-The application is built with TypeScript and supports both iOS and Android platforms.
Components
The application includes several custom components:

Header Component: A reusable header for consistent navigation and branding across the app.
Card Component: A customizable card for displaying user information and other content.
Tab Components: Two custom tabs for navigating between the input page and the display page.
Custom Styling: User scale for responsiveness and a consistent color scheme for theming.

Features:
